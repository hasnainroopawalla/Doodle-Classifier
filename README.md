# Doodle-Classifier
The notebook includes downloading the classes.txt file as well as the entire dataset

The 100_classes.txt consists of a subset of the 345 original classes

The number of images used per class is limited to 16000 to increase training speed

With the given architecture I was able to obtain 94.29% accuracy (Can be improved by using more images)


Instructions:

Run the Doodle.ipynb on Google Colab (GPU for more disk memory)
